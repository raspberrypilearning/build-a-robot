## Izazov: dodaj svoje slike

Can you create images to add to your robot, and position them on your webpage?

+ If you don't have a drawing software tool, you could use the Scratch paint tool in **Bitmap** mode to draw some new robot parts. Use **save as local file** to save a costume as a `.png` image.

+ Then upload the `.png` image into your trinket:
    
    ![screenshot](images/robot-image-add.png)

+ Add the image to `index.html`:
    
        <img id="purpleeyes" src="purpleeyes.png">
        

+ And add CSS code to `style.css` to position it:
