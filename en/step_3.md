## Giving your robot a mouth

Let’s give your robot a mouth!



+ Add the following CSS code to style your `mouth1` image:

```
#mouth1 {
    width: 50px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 200px;
    left: 200px;
}
```

+ Your robot’s mouth looks quite small, and isn’t in the right place.

Can you fix this, by making changes to your CSS?
