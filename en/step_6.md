## Challenge: Add your own images
Can you create images to add to your robot, and position them on your webpage? 

+ If you don't have a drawing tool then you could use the paint tool in Scratch in Bitmap mode to draw some new robot parts. Use 'save as local file' to save a costume as a '.png' image.

+ Then upload the '.png' image into Trinket.

+ Add the image to `index.html`: 

	```
	<img id="purpleeyes" src="purpleeyes.png">
	```

+ And add CSS to `style.css` to position it:
