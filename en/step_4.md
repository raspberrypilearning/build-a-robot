## Giving your robot a mouth

Let’s give your robot a mouth!

+ Add the following CSS code at the bottom of `style.css` to style your `mouth1` image:

    ```
    #mouth1 {
        width: 50px;
        position: absolute;
        top: 200px;
        left: 200px;
    }
    ```

Your robot’s mouth looks quite small, and it isn’t in the right place!

- Can you fix this by making changes to your CSS code?

You'll need to change the `width` and the `top` and `left` positions for `mouth1` in `style.css`. 

Try different values until it looks the way you want.
