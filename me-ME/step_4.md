Let’s give your robot a mouth!

- Add the following CSS code at the bottom of `style.css` to style your `mouth1` image:
    
        #mouth1 {
            width: 50px;
            position: absolute;
            top: 200px;
            left: 200px;
        }
        

Your robot’s mouth looks quite small, and it isn’t in the right place!
